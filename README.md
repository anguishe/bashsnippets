I got tired of digging the same scripts out of my own notes every time a disk filled up, a service died, or a cron job overlapped itself into an outage. This repo is those scripts: tested, copy-paste bash for real Linux boxes and cron jobs, each one explained line-by-line at [bashsnippets.xyz](https://bashsnippets.xyz). No login, no paywall, no newsletter wall — clone it, read it, run it.

**Every script in this repo:**

- runs `set -euo pipefail` — stops on the first error instead of marching past it
- uses named variables for thresholds and paths — no magic numbers to guess at
- comments explain *why* a line exists, not *what* it does
- is **ShellCheck-clean** (`shellcheck -S style`, zero findings) and mirrors the tested version explained line-by-line on the site

## Explained on the site

Two pages earn their place as full explainers rather than a single copy-paste script — a strict-mode pattern you add to *every* script, and a command reference you run interactively. They live on the site, not in `scripts/`:

- [Bash error handling with `set -euo pipefail`](https://bashsnippets.xyz/snippets/bash-error-handling)
- [Kill a process by name with `pgrep` / `pkill`](https://bashsnippets.xyz/snippets/kill-a-process)

## Browser tools

Some of these jobs are faster to build in a form than to hand-write — a cron schedule, a hardened wrapper, a chmod calculator. The interactive versions live at [bashsnippets.xyz/tools](https://bashsnippets.xyz/tools).

The production layer these scripts don't cover — logging, locking, alerting wired together — is the [Production Bash Toolkit](https://bashsnippets.xyz/starter-kit).
